; A turing machine that transforms a tape of 0 into a tape of 1

{0 0 0 0}     ; The input tape

[BEGIN s]     ; The initial state
[FINAL q]     ; The final state (here just 1, could be more)

; s = going to the right and changing the value
; x = going to the left

(s 0 s 1 R)
(s . x . L)
(x 1 x 1 L)
(x . q . R)
